# Mapping_Web-Vizualization

Import & Visualize the Data
Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.


The data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.


Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when the user click on it is

Create a legend that will provide context for the map data.
