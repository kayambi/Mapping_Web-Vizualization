#Visualizing Data with Leaflet

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.

Overview

Problem: The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.
Organization: Uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a map using Leaflet.js that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.
How to run: Run the HTML web page in a browser.
Deployed app:https://kayambi.github.io/Mapping_Web-Vizualization/
